In Australia studies report that between 20% and 45% of the dog and cat population are clinically obese. Many illnesses are related to obesity including arthritis, heart disease, liver disease, diabetes and cancer that unfortunately compromise the pet’s enjoyment and length of life.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I know if my pet is overweight?</strong></p>\n<p>A pet is considered overweight when it weighs 15% more than its ideal body weight and obese when it weighs 30% more than its ideal body weight. A good way to work out whether your pet is overweight is to run your hands down either side of your pet’s body. Can you feel your pet’s ribs through a thin layer of fat but not see them? Does your pet have a nipped’ in’ waist? If so they are an ideal body weight. If not, read on…</p>\n<p><strong>How did my pet get overweight?</strong></p>\n<p>Obesity can be the result of multiple factors. Not enough exercise or medical problems such as hypothyroidism, or genetic factors can all play a role. However, the single biggest factor is calorie intake – how much your pet is eating! This also means that diet change is the single most effective tool in reversing obesity! Knowing how much to feed your pet can be tricky. Remember your pet will often not know when to stop and will always ask for food it doesn’t need. It’s very easy to overfeed a food motivated pet but staying trim will change your pet’s health forever!</p>\n<p><strong>I think my pet needs to lose a few kilograms, what do I do now?</strong></p>\n<p>Make an appointment for a health check and to talk to one of our veterinarians to make sure that your pet is in good health. The veterinarian will refer you to the Hills® PetFit program. Our highly skilled vet nurse dieticians run the program. The nurse works out a feeding and exercise regime that suits you both. All pets go on a specially formulated Hills r/d ® prescription diet which is low in calories but still nutritionally complete. Your pet needs to come back every 2-3 weeks for a free ‘weight in’. This is to help make sure that everything is going okay, to adjust feeding amounts or to check if you are having any problems. Depending on the amount of weight your pet needs to lose, ideal body weight can be achieved from between 3 to 6months. All nurse weight clinics are FREE.</p>\n<p><strong>What happens when my pet achieves ideal body weight?</strong></p>\n<p>Once your pet has achieved ideal weight we generally switch your pet on to a light diet. Light diets have fewer calories but help to make your pet feel fuller between meals whilst still being nutritionally complete. The nurse will still want to see your pet in 2-3 weeks time to make sure that the feeding amount is right for your pet. Depending on the results of this you will only need to come back every 1-3 months just to make sure you’re pet’s weight remains stable. If all goes well over that period you will only need to come back for your pet’s annual health check. For your own records however we do recommend you reweigh your pet every 1-3 months. You can swing by anytime to do this on our scales for free. The weight is then recorded on our records too.</p>\n<p>Make an appointment today to join PetFit. PetFit is a pet weight loss programme, supported by Hills® specially developed to give you and your pet a new lease of life together. By helping your pet slim down to their ideal shape, you will reduce their risk of illness related to obesity. Better still, being fitter may help your pet live a happier, healthier and longer life, so you can enjoy more happy times together.</p>\n<p>Like to sign up?

On the other hand, they can also escape outdoors, they can crash into things and they may fly away instead of interacting with you and stop being as tame. Your new budgie or cockatiel may already have clipped wings when it first comes home. Remember, birds moult their feathers once a year, and the wing feathers will grow back, so you can change your mind about wing clipping or not.</p>\n<p style=\"color:#222222;font-family:\'-apple-system\', BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, \'Helvetica Neue\', Arial, sans-serif, \'Apple Color Emoji\', \'Segoe UI Emoji\', \'Segoe UI Symbol\';font-size:15px;\">Your bird does need a cage or somewhere secure and familiar so it can feel safe, especially at night.  Birds want to go to bed when the sun goes down and get up at dawn.  Some budgies and cockatiels get quite stressed by lack of sleep.</p>\n<p style=\"color:#222222;font-family:\'-apple-system\', BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, \'Helvetica Neue\', Arial, sans-serif, \'Apple Color Emoji\', \'Segoe UI Emoji\', \'Segoe UI Symbol\';font-size:15px;\">The cage needs to be made of powder coated/painted wire.  Birds tend to go to the highest point in a cage for safety, so a tall, thin cage has much less available space than a short wide one.  Most birds love to play with toys and there are lots available.  Be careful of toys made of metal, as some types of metal, namely zinc, lead and copper in particular, are toxic.  Toys made of rope, wood and stainless steel are the safest.  Toxicity often occurs with cheap, flimsy bells and they are best avoided.</p>\n<p style=\"color:#222222;font-family:\'-apple-system\', BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, \'Helvetica Neue\', Arial, sans-serif, \'Apple Color Emoji\', \'Segoe UI Emoji\', \'Segoe UI Symbol\';font-size:15px;\">Getting the diet right from the very beginning is vital for cockatiels and budgerigars to live long healthy lives.  In the wild cockatiels and budgies eat a wide ranging foraging diet.  If they only eat seed, because it is very high in fat and low in many vitamins and minerals, obesity and dietary deficiencies will occur.  We often find that seed eating budgies and cockatiels do not live to their expected life expectancy, this is a great loss! We recommend a mix of seed, fresh vegies and Vetafarm® bird pellets.  Read our Nutrition Information sheets or visit us at Inner South Veterinary Centre. We are always happy to talk bird!

Spring is the time where cats venture out and are more likely to get into trouble.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>What is FIV?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Feline immunodeficiency virus or FIV is a viral infection of cats that is similar in many ways to Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in people. Although HIV and FIV are very similar FIV only infects cats and HIV only infects humans. Thus there is no risk of infection for people in contact with FIV-positive cats. But your cat might be at risk!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Which cats are at risk?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The most common method of spread of FIV is from bites during fighting. For this reason cats that live outside, have a feisty nature and get into fights, particularly with stray cats in the area are at increased risk. However, your peaceful moggy is still at risk if she is being beaten up the neighbourhood feral! It only takes one bite for your cat to end up with a lifelong infection!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>What is FIV and how does it cause disease?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">FIV affects the immune system causing a gradual decline in the cat’s immune function. Early stages of infection may not cause many problems but as the disease progresses, infected cats will be unable to fight of infections and may also be at increased risk of cancer and other diseases.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>What are the clinical signs of an FIV infection</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The signs of FIV infection are fairly non-specific. Early on in the course of the disease they may be just ‘off colour’. Later on, the cat’s poor ability to fight off infection can leave them prone to many infections and diseases. They are also at increased risk of developing some cancers. These conditions can take many forms and therefore the clinical signs are quite variable. Some diseases are more common in FIV infected cats than in other cats. Nasty inflammation of the gums and infection around the teeth is often seen, as well as chronic snuffling and sneezing, or chronic eye infections.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>How is FIV diagnosed?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There are several different blood tests for diagnosing FIV infection. Many of these tests can be done in-house.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Treatment options</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">To date there is no antiviral treatment that has been shown to reverse an established FIV infection. The main aim of management of an FIV-infected cat is to concentrate on keeping them healthy and avoiding challenges to their immune system. This means ensuring they have good dental health, avoiding cat fights, maintaining a healthy bladder and healthy weight. If they do become sick, it is important to act quickly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Long-term management of the FIV-infected cat</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Cats infected with FIV should ideally be kept indoors, for their own protection and to prevent spread of the virus to other cats. Good nutrition is essential to maintain good health, we recommend a premium food like Hill’s Science diet. It is best to avoid raw meat because the risk of food-borne bacterial and parasitic infections. It’s important to stay up to date with flea, worm and tick prevention and vaccination. Cats infected with FIV should receive wellness visits at least every 6 months to promptly detect changes in their health status.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Vaccination</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">A vaccine for FIV is available. The vaccine is not fool proof but will offer most cats protection most of the time. If your cat is at high risk of infection, such as an outside cat that gets into fights, then vaccination may be right for them. For cats at low risk of infection, such as indoor only cats, vaccination is not necessary. If one cat in a household is confirmed to be FIV positive there are options to protect the other cats in the home. It is recommended to vaccinate the uninfected cats to give them added protection. It may be helpful to feed cats using separate food bowls. Litter trays and food bowls should be disinfected after use.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Prognosis for infected cats</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The prognosis for FIV-infected cats is not as grim as first thought. If the diagnosis of FIV infection is reached early in the course of the disease, there may be a long period during which the cat is free of clinical signs related to FIV. If good health is maintained and any stress on the immune system is managed than most cats will remain well. Progression of the disease may happen and some cats do die from FIV related illness but many cats live out a happy life despite infection.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Some of the information extracted from the International Cat Care website.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">In the months of September and October Inner South Veterinary Centre is running FIV Awareness month.

With black and brown you have a bit more time...</p><p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>Symptoms can vary with different snakes but sudden onset of seizures, vomiting, weakness in the limbs and inability to move may be observed. Soon after the symptoms occur, the animal may collapse with laboured breathing.</p><p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>Although snake bites can be deadly, rapid treatment with the appropriate anti-venom can be a very effective treatment if done quickly.</p>\n<p>If you spot any of these symptoms in your pet or even suspect a snake bite, quickly call the vet hospital so that we can be prepared for your arrival. </p>\n<p>And remember, snakes left undisturbed will not disturb you!</p>','With the arrival of spring, snakes are posing a greater threat to pets as the warmer weather and dryer conditions put an end to their winter hibernation. Snakes are beautiful, peaceful creatures....they are only dangerous if scared...like the rest of us!','','','beware_of_snakes.jpg',1,1,7,'2018-08-08 20:07:12','2018-08-08 20:07:12'),(12,'Ticks - the quiet killers','ticks-the-quiet-killers','<p>We are again warning pet owners to be vigilant after an unprecedented number of tick paralysis cases in Queensland, NSW and ACT for the start of the spring season. Unfortunately Canberra has not been spared!</p>\n<p>There have been 585 cases of tick paralysis reported in the last three months on the east coast, including more than 200 tick paralysis cases in the last month, resulting in 31 fatalities.</p>\n<p>At Inner South Veterinary Centre we have already treated five cases of tick paralysis this spring, and are deeply saddened at the loss of one beautiful dog. Dogs who live locally in Manuka, Red Hill and Deakin have been affected. Most of them have been down to the south coast, and one to Sydney.</p>\n<p>Prevention is the key!</p>\n<p>Animals visiting the coast or Sydney should be on an effective tick-prevention program to reduce the risk of picking up a life-threatening tick.</p>\n<p>According to the Disease WatchDog, it is the earliest start to the tick season since they started recording tick paralysis cases, following a very early wet and warm spring.</p>\n<p>Paralysis ticks are usually found in long grass and scrub, particularly in coastal areas. They tend to attach to the head and neck area of the pet and on the chest and the front of the leg, but can be found on any part of the body.</p>\n<p>Ticks release a toxin when they feed, which leads to a condition known as tick toxicity. It’s critical to take action immediately if you notice any symptoms.</p>\n<p>Common signs of tick toxicity include:</p>\n<ul><li>weakness in the hind legs</li>\n<li>being unable to bark properly due to paralysis of the throat</li>\n<li>coughing when eating or drinking or coughing up food and water</li>\n<li>breathing difficulties</li>\n<li>gurgling and choking</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Pet owners should ideally check dogs and cats daily when they are down the coast and for about 10 days after returning from a trip to the coast, even if tick-preventatives have been applied. This can be done by \'finger walking\' your hands over the animal’s coat to feel for anything unusual. In cats, ticks often latch on around the back of the neck where they cannot groom, so it’s important to pay attention to this area.</p>\n<div>\n<p>Even if you find and remove a tick it’s important to keep an eye on your pet as they can be affected by the toxin for days after removal.</p>\n</div>','We are again warning pet owners to be vigilant after an unprecedented number of tick paralysis cases in Queensland, NSW and ACT for the start of the spring season.

It’s usual routine, right? Well, as we learn more and more about our pets and as veterinary science advances some of our routines need to change. This is all part of the science of keeping our pets happy, healthy and living longer!</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px;color:#747474;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Vaccination is one of the most common veterinary procedures. Vaccination programs have played an important role in preventing diseases and helping with early detection and treatment of problems through regular health checks during the life of the animal. Vaccination programmes in the past were considered a simple part of animal care, but are now a complex and controversial issue. It is being recognised that veterinarians should aim to reduce the vaccine load on individual animals to minimise the risk of adverse reactions to the products.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px;color:#747474;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">You might have read about the changes to canine vaccinations in the media over the past few years. Research has emerged that the core vaccinations against parvo, distemper and hepatitis viruses (C3) may not need to be given annually as previously thought. Once the dogs are adults a booster vaccination every three years for parvo, distemper and hepatitis viruses may be sufficient to protect your pet. (This is NOT the case for Kennel Cough vaccination however). This is quite similar to the changes that we see to human vaccination schedules from time to time. As science evolves, so too do the schedules recommended to protect our beloved canine family members!</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px;color:#747474;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Wwe have been following this developing area of research closely and we feel that the evidence is now there to support a change. We’ve taken our time and really looked deeply into this issue. We just do not want to take any risks with your pet (or with our own!). We now feel that the time has come to change the core (C3) vaccinations of dogs to a three yearly basis. Kennel Cough vaccination however would still remain as an annual booster. The Australian Veterinary Association (AVA), the nationwide association of Australian vets, and the international organisation, the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) supports this change. Boarding kennels also accept these changes in vaccination schedules.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px;color:#747474;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">So what does this mean for vaccination of your dog?</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px;color:#747474;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">When you come for your annual health check, we will together decide the best vaccination schedule for your dog. Every third year dogs will be given a triennial C3 vaccine. The vaccinations against Kennel Cough – a very serious respiratory disease – need to be given each year. Most dogs also need their annual Proheart® heart worm preventative injection.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px;color:#747474;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">The <span style=\"font-size:inherit;font-weight:bold;\">annual health check</span> is still vitally important.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px;color:#747474;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">For our cats and dogs one human year is the same as about seven years in their lives. We need to make sure they have a yearly check up at the vet as most people do with their doctor. In effect this visit is equivalent to a visit to the doctor every seven years!</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px;color:#747474;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">We will check for any signs of disease, make sure their teeth, skin, ears and eyes are healthy and update you on preventative measures for problems like fleas, ticks, heartworm and intestinal worms.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px;color:#747474;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Finding any health problems early can save you time and money now and, more importantly possibly even save your pet’s life.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px;color:#747474;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">It’s important to remember that a yearly check up is really essential, and as your pet gets older twice yearly check ups, because like humans, their health problems increase. It allows them to live to their full potential, which is great for both of you. Remember, vaccination is all about preventing serious disease and we want to do that in the best and safest way possible.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px;color:#747474;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">This article was wrtten by the vets at <a href=\"https://www.innersouthvets.com.au/\">Inner South Veterinary Hospital, Canberra</a></p>','Once a year you come in to the vet with your dog and they have their annual vaccinations.
